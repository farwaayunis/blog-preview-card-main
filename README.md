## Overview
Our card for blogging The goal of the HTML/CSS project is to develop practical and aesthetically pleasing blog cards that can be used to showcase blog post samples on a website. Stylistic elements like a border, border-radius, and light box-shadow. The card's top half is occupied by the image, then the title and description. The hover effect and contrasting color of the 'Read More' link draw attention to it and encourage people to explore further. This project provides an adaptable framework for effectively and aesthetically presenting blog content on any website.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
